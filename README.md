# Analysis Observations

  A common topic of discussion when it comes to the success or failure of a school is typically around how much spending is done to help it's students. The logical assumption is that if more money is spent per student, or overall on the school itself, then success is likely to follow. However, based on the analysis of this data, the opposite conlusion is met - that the less spending that was used on a student, the better they achieved. As shown in the summary table "Scores by School Spending," students that had less than $585 spent on them, on average, had higher math and reading scores and had much higher pass percentages than students with more than $645 spent on them.
