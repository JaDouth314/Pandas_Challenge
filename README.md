# Analysis Observations

  A common topic of discussion when it comes to the success or failure of a school is typically around how much spending is done to help it's students. The logical assumption is that if more money is spent per student, or overall on the school itself, then success is likely to follow. However, based on the analysis of this data, the opposite conlusion is met - that the less spending that was used on a student, the better they achieved. As shown in the summary table "Scores by School Spending," students that had less than $585 spent on them, on average, had higher math and reading scores and had much higher pass percentages than students with more than $645 spent on them.
  
  Another notable topic is the size of the class or student body being a factor of success. It is typically believed that a smaller class size is better for a student as they are likely to recieve more focus from their instructors and have their problems answers more quickly and thoroughly, while a student in a larger class/school will not. From the summary table "Scores by School Size," the data shows this to be the case as students from school with sizes less than 2,000 have notably higher average academic scores and passing rates.
